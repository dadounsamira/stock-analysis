# stock-analysis


## Overview of project

Steve parent's are very passionate about grenne energy and decided to invest all their money in DAQO New Energy Corpwithout doing much research, Stve as new graduate and and finance passionate want to analyse handful of green energy stocks in addition to DAQO stocks to  diverify the portfolio and mitigate the risk of putting all the money in one product.
Included the source of this dataset [here](/VBA_Challenge.xlsm.xlsm)
 
 ### Data and methodology
 
 All the data used in this analysis  is taken from the WALL STREET. The sample include 12 companies and covers 2 yeasr 2017 and 2018.
 
 Steve's parents believe that if a stock is traded often, the price will accurately reflect the value of the stock. So to visualize the stock performance and to measure how      actively DQ was traded , we created spreadsheet and applied the following fields :Year,Total Daily Volume and Return.

 If we sum up all of the daily volume for each stock, we'll have the yearly volume and a rough idea of how often it gets traded.
 To do so , we used loops to to calculate the total daily volume.


## Results

### the stock performance in  2017

 At first look the table below reveals that all stocks (except TERP) performed well and reflected  positive average return. DQ stock outperformed all the other stock.

 We can conclude that 2017 was a great year for the green energy industry.

 Here is the graphics that shows the results .

For this analysis we used the same methods, the graphics shows that the green energy industry crashed in 2018 and that all stocks went down except ENPH and RUN who outperformed well.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I encountered some difficulties producing some visualizations because of my lack of knowledge in excel but the extra sessions with the assistant teacher helped me solve my issues, also had hard time getting familiar with github. 



## Results


### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

The graphic Outcomes by Launch Date shows that most successful projects are launched in May and June, May being the pick month, two factors explains this trend the weather and the end of tax return, as the weather get nicer people tend to be more joyful and more willing to put money in fundraising especially after getting some tax return.
Also to note that December is the worst month to launch a project as the failed and successful project tends to be in same level thats because of christmas, people tends to spend a lot of money during christmas.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script? 

The dateset shows that there is a higher probability of successful projects lower the goal is however there is higher probability of successful funding projects with a goal between 20000 and 35000 and projects above 40000.
this might lead Louise to conclude that for smaller project it might be neccessary to try attracting a type of range of the population people with small income, student in art,.... and project with higher goals need to be directed toward middle higher income population.
